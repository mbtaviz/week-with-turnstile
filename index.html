      This animation shows congestion and delay on Boston's Red, Orange, and
      Blue Subway lines for one week in February.  The color between stops indicates
      delay: black means trains are taking twice as long as normal to get
      between stops and red means even longer delays.  The thickness of each line
      at a stop indicates the number of people per minute entering that station at that
      time. <a class="desc" href="http://mbtaviz.github.io/delays">Realtime delay</a>
      is also available.
